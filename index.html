                Mr. Tata’s dedication to philanthropy and the development of society has touched the
                lives of millions. From education to healthcare, his initiatives have left a deep-rooted
                mark that will benefit generations to come. Reinforcing all of this work was Mr. Tata’s
                genuine humility in every individual interaction. On behalf of the entire Tata family,
                I extend our deepest condolences to his loved ones. His legacy will continue to inspire
